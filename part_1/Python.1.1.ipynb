    "## Overview of Python and its uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python's popularity is due to its versatility and wide range of applications, which include web development, scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, network automation, and artificial intelligence. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python also has a large and active community that contributes to its development and supports users through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn:** Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Python has a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning, making it a versatile language to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large and Active Community:** Python has a large and active community of users who contribute to its development and provide support through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excellent Libraries and Frameworks:** Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop complex applications quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python code can be run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a flexible choice for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slower Execution Speeds:** Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. This can be a disadvantage in performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the performance of multithreaded applications, which can be a concern for applications that require high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, which means that type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time. This can lead to more errors in code that are not caught until runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Less Suitable for Mobile App Development:** Python is not well-suited for mobile app development due to its slower performance and limitations on mobile platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Compatibility:** Python has multiple versions, and code written in one version may not be compatible with other versions, which can be a concern for developers. (less relevant since Python2 is no longer in scope. Most libraries and packages work well with all Python3 distributions)\n",

    "## Running Python code in the interpreter and in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in the interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is a command-line interface that allows you to execute Python code directly in the terminal. This is useful for quick testing and debugging of code snippets. Here is an example of running Python code in the interpreter:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf> python\n",
    "Python 3.11.3 (tags/v3.11.3:f3909b8, Apr  4 2023, 23:49:59) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "Hello world!\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we start the Python interpreter by running the `python` command in the terminal. Once inside the interpreter, we can execute Python code by typing it directly into the terminal. In this case, we print the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code can also be saved in a file with a `.py` extension and executed using the Python interpreter. This is useful for more complex programs and allows you to save and share your code. Here is an example of running Python code in a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`hello.py`\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a file called `hello.py` and save it in our current working directory. The file contains a single line of Python code that prints the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function. To execute the code in the file, we run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf\\part_1> python .\\hello.py\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will execute the code in the `hello.py` file using the Python interpreter and print the output to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between running Python code in the interpreter and in a file is that the interpreter allows you to execute code line-by-line and experiment with Python features interactively, while running code in a file allows you to create more complex programs and execute them as a whole.\n",

    "## Chapter 2: Basic Python Syntax and Data Types  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Variables and variable types\n",
    "* **1.1. What are variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named reference to a value that can be manipulated by your program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and collections like lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables don't have a type specified at the time they are created. Instead, their type is determined dynamically based on the value that is assigned to them. This allows for more flexibility in programming, but can also lead to potential errors if variables are not used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common variable types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers**: Variables that hold whole numbers, such as `42` or `-3`.\n",
    "- **Floating point numbers**: Variables that hold decimal numbers, such as `3.14` or `-0.5`.\n",
    "- **Strings**: Variables that hold text, such as `\"Hello, world!\"` or `'Python is awesome!'`.\n",
    "- **Booleans**: Variables that hold either `True` or `False` values, which are used for logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has some collection variable types, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Lists are defined using square brackets, such as `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Tuples are defined using parentheses, such as `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, which can be of different types. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces, such as `{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable types and how to use them correctly is fundamental to programming in Python. It allows you to store and manipulate different types of data, and perform various operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.2. Creating variables**: \n",
    "To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the equal sign `=`. The basic syntax for creating a variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable_name` is the name of the variable, and `value` is the value that you want to assign to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create an integer variable `x` with the value of `5`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to create a string variable `name` with the value of `\"Alice\"`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list variable `my_list` with a list of numbers, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple variable `my_tuple` with a tuple of strings, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dictionary variable `my_dict` with a dictionary of key-value pairs, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"gender\": \"female\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.3. Naming conventions for variables:**\n",
    "In Python, there are some general naming conventions for variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "2. Variables should start with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "3. If a variable name contains more than one word, use underscores (_) to separate the words. This is called snake_case naming convention.\n",
    "4. Avoid using reserved keywords, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `else`, etc., as variable names.\n",
    "5. Use uppercase letters only for constants, which are values that never change during the program's execution. By convention, constants are named using all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of good variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "hourly_rate = 15.50\n",
    "MAX_RETRIES = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.4. Mutable/Immutable:**\n",
    "In Python, mutable types are the types of objects whose values can be changed after they are created, while immutable types are the types of objects whose values cannot be changed after they are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable types:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable types:\n",
    "- Numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers)\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Frozen sets (immutable sets)\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an immutable object is created, its value cannot be changed. If you try to change the value of an immutable object, Python will create a new object with the new value instead. On the other hand, for mutable objects, you can change their values directly without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Numbers and arithmetic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative. In Python, integers have unlimited precision, meaning that they can be arbitrarily large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum and maximum representable integers in Python are available through the `sys` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.maxsize)      # 9223372036854775807 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "print(-sys.maxsize - 1) # -9223372036854775808 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common operations with integers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.1. Arithmetic Operators:**\n",
    "- Addition: `3 + 2`\n",
    "- Subtraction: `3 - 2`\n",
    "- Multiplication: `3 * 2`\n",
    "- Division: `3 / 2`\n",
    "- Floor Division: `3 // 2`  *divides 3 by 2 and returns the floor of the result (1).*\n",
    "- Exponent: `3 ** 2`  *raises 3 to the power of 2 (9).*\n",
    "- Modulus: `3 % 2` *divides 3 by 2 and returns the remainder (1).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.2. Comparisons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equal: `3 == 2`\n",
    "- Not Equal: `3 != 2`\n",
    "- Greater Than: `3 > 2`\n",
    "- Less Than: `3 < 2`\n",
    "- Greater or Equal: `3 >= 2`\n",
    "- Less or Equal: `3 <= 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(3 + 2)    # 5\n",
    "print(3 - 2)    # 1\n",
    "print(3 * 2)    # 6\n",
    "print(3 / 2)    # 1.5\n",
    "print(3 // 2)   # 1\n",
    "print(3 ** 2)   # 9\n",
    "print(3 % 2)    # 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(3 == 2)   # False\n",
    "print(3 != 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 > 2)    # True\n",
    "print(3 < 2)    # False\n",
    "print(3 >= 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 <= 2)   # False\n",

    "### SubChapter 3. Strings and string manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.1. What is a string:** A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They can be manipulated in various ways to extract or change parts of the string.<br>\n",

    "It can contain multiple lines of text.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.2. String methods:** Python provides several built-in methods for working with strings. Some of the most common ones include `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `find()`, `startswith()`, and `endswith()`. Knowing how to use these methods can help with common string manipulations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lower()`: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"HELLO\".lower()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `upper()`: Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello\".upper()` returns `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
    "- `strip()`: Removes whitespace from both ends of the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"   hello   \".strip()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `replace()`: Replaces a specified substring with another substring in the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".replace(\"world\", \"Python\")` returns `\"hello Python\"`.\n",
    "- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello,world\".split(\",\")` returns `[\"hello\", \"world\"]`.\n",
    "- `join()`: Joins a sequence of strings into a single string using the string as a delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\", \".join([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])` returns `\"apple, banana, cherry\"`.\n",
    "- `find()`: Searches the string for a specified substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".find(\"world\")` returns `6`.\n",
    "- `startswith()`: Returns `True` if the string starts with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".startswith(\"hello\")` returns `True`.\n",
    "- `endswith()`: Returns `True` if the string ends with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",

    "* **3.4. String formatting:** Python provides several ways to format strings, including using the `%` operator, the `format()` method, and `f-strings` (we will be focusing on these). Understanding how to use string formatting can make code more readable and maintainable.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*`f-strings`*, also known as formatted string literals or f-string literals for short, provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax. To create an f-string, you start a string with the letter \"f\" or \"F\" before the opening quotation mark of a string. You can then embed Python expressions(or more typically variables) inside the string by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`. <br>\n",
    "Inside the curly braces we can put any python object that has a string representation (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of using `f-strings`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Example 1: Using f-strings to print variables\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "age = 30\n",
    "print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### My name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Using f-strings for calculations\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "print(f\"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a + b}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### The sum of 10 and 20 is 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Using f-strings with dictionary values\n",
    "person = {\"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "print(f\"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### Jane is 25 years old.\n",

    "* **3.5. Regular expressions:** Regular expressions are a powerful tool for string manipulation. They allow you to search for patterns within a string and extract or replace matching substrings. Python's `re` module provides support for regular expressions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.6. Unicode and encoding:** Unicode is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique number (code point) to each character in many writing systems. Python 3 uses Unicode for all strings, which makes it easier to work with non-ASCII characters. However, when working with files or network protocols, you may need to convert between different encoding schemes.<br>\n",

    "* **5.1. What are tuples and how do we create them?**\n",
    "Tuples are ordered collections of items that are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are usually used to hold related pieces of data that don't need to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple manipulation includes operations like creating, accessing, slicing, and concatenating tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple, we use parentheses and separate the items with commas. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **5.2 Tuple methods:**\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning that their contents cannot be changed once created. Therefore, they have fewer methods than lists. Here are some of the most common tuple methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count()`: Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.count(5)` returns the number of times `5` appears in `my_tuple`.\n",
    "2. `index()`: Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the index of its first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.index(3)` returns the index of the first occurrence of `3` in `my_tuple`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that both `count()` and `index()` methods do not modify the original tuple but only return some information about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **5.3 Tuple operators:**\n",
    "Tuples in Python do not have any specific operators of their own. However, they can be used with some of the built-in operators and functions in Python, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indexing operator `[]`: Used to access individual elements of a tuple by their index.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(my_tuple[0])` will output `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concatenation operator `+`: Used to concatenate two or more tuples into a single tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)` ; `print(my_tuple)` will output `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repetition operator `*`: Used to repeat a tuple a certain number of times.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2) * 3` ; `print(my_tuple)` will output `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Membership operator `in`: Used to check if an element is present in a tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(2 in my_tuple)` will output `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Membership operator `not in`: Used to check if an element is not present in a tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(4 not in my_tuple)` will output `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tuples are immutable, so the use of operators that modify them, such as the assignment operator `=`, will result in a new tuple being created instead of modifying the original one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 6. Dictionaries and dictionary manipulation\n",
    "* **6.1. What are dictionaries:**\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are also known as associative arrays, maps, or hash maps in other programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` with each item consisting of a key-value pair separated by a colon `:`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the keys are strings (`'apple'`, `'banana'`, and `'cherry'`) and the values are integers (`2`, `3`, and `5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a dictionary using the `dict()` constructor, passing in a sequence of key-value pairs as tuples or using keyword arguments. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dict = dict(apple=2, banana=3, cherry=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **6.2. Dictionary methods:**\n",
    "Here are some common dictionary methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `clear()`: Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_dict.clear()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `new_dict = my_dict.copy()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `get(key[, default])`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it returns the default value. If the default value is not provided, it returns `None`.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.get('key', 'default_value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `items()`: Returns a view object that contains key-value pairs of the dictionary as tuples.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_items = my_dict.items()`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `keys()`: Returns a view object that contains all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_keys = my_dict.keys()`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `values()`: Returns a view object that contains all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_values = my_dict.values()`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `pop(key[, default])`: Removes the key-value pair for the given key and returns the value. If the key is not present in the dictionary and no default value is provided, it raises a `KeyError`.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.pop('key', 'default_value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `popitem()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary as a tuple. If the dictionary is empty, it raises a `KeyError`.\n",
    "   - Example: `key_value_pair = my_dict.popitem()`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `setdefault(key[, default])`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it sets the key with the default value and returns it. If the default value is not provided, it sets the key with `None` and returns it.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.setdefault('key', 'default_value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `update(other_dict)`: Updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from the other dictionary. If a key already exists in the dictionary, the corresponding value gets updated.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_dict.update(other_dict)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The above methods are not exhaustive and there are many more methods available in dictionaries in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **6.3. Dictionary \"operators\":**\n",
    "There are no specific \"operators\" for dictionaries in Python. However, you can use the `in` operator to check if a key exists in a dictionary. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create a dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if a key exists\n",
    "if 'apple' in my_dict:\n",
    "    print('Apple exists in the dictionary!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `in` operator is used to check if the key `'apple'` exists in the `my_dict` dictionary. If it does, the message \"Apple exists in the dictionary!\" is printed."
