    "## Overview of Python and its uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python's popularity is due to its versatility and wide range of applications, which include web development, scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, network automation, and artificial intelligence. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python also has a large and active community that contributes to its development and supports users through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn:** Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Python has a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning, making it a versatile language to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large and Active Community:** Python has a large and active community of users who contribute to its development and provide support through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excellent Libraries and Frameworks:** Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop complex applications quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python code can be run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a flexible choice for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slower Execution Speeds:** Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. This can be a disadvantage in performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the performance of multithreaded applications, which can be a concern for applications that require high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, which means that type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time. This can lead to more errors in code that are not caught until runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Less Suitable for Mobile App Development:** Python is not well-suited for mobile app development due to its slower performance and limitations on mobile platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Compatibility:** Python has multiple versions, and code written in one version may not be compatible with other versions, which can be a concern for developers. (less relevant since Python2 is no longer in scope. Most libraries and packages work well with all Python3 distributions)\n",

    "## Running Python code in the interpreter and in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in the interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is a command-line interface that allows you to execute Python code directly in the terminal. This is useful for quick testing and debugging of code snippets. Here is an example of running Python code in the interpreter:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf> python\n",
    "Python 3.11.3 (tags/v3.11.3:f3909b8, Apr  4 2023, 23:49:59) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "Hello world!\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we start the Python interpreter by running the `python` command in the terminal. Once inside the interpreter, we can execute Python code by typing it directly into the terminal. In this case, we print the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code can also be saved in a file with a `.py` extension and executed using the Python interpreter. This is useful for more complex programs and allows you to save and share your code. Here is an example of running Python code in a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`hello.py`\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a file called `hello.py` and save it in our current working directory. The file contains a single line of Python code that prints the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function. To execute the code in the file, we run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf\\part_1> python .\\hello.py\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will execute the code in the `hello.py` file using the Python interpreter and print the output to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between running Python code in the interpreter and in a file is that the interpreter allows you to execute code line-by-line and experiment with Python features interactively, while running code in a file allows you to create more complex programs and execute them as a whole.\n",

    "## Chapter 2: Basic Python Syntax and Data Types  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Variables and variable types\n",
    "* **1.1. What are variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named reference to a value that can be manipulated by your program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and collections like lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables don't have a type specified at the time they are created. Instead, their type is determined dynamically based on the value that is assigned to them. This allows for more flexibility in programming, but can also lead to potential errors if variables are not used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common variable types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers**: Variables that hold whole numbers, such as `42` or `-3`.\n",
    "- **Floating point numbers**: Variables that hold decimal numbers, such as `3.14` or `-0.5`.\n",
    "- **Strings**: Variables that hold text, such as `\"Hello, world!\"` or `'Python is awesome!'`.\n",
    "- **Booleans**: Variables that hold either `True` or `False` values, which are used for logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has some collection variable types, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Lists are defined using square brackets, such as `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Tuples are defined using parentheses, such as `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, which can be of different types. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces, such as `{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable types and how to use them correctly is fundamental to programming in Python. It allows you to store and manipulate different types of data, and perform various operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.2. Creating variables**: \n",
    "To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the equal sign `=`. The basic syntax for creating a variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable_name` is the name of the variable, and `value` is the value that you want to assign to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create an integer variable `x` with the value of `5`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to create a string variable `name` with the value of `\"Alice\"`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list variable `my_list` with a list of numbers, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple variable `my_tuple` with a tuple of strings, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dictionary variable `my_dict` with a dictionary of key-value pairs, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"gender\": \"female\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.3. Naming conventions for variables:**\n",
    "In Python, there are some general naming conventions for variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "2. Variables should start with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "3. If a variable name contains more than one word, use underscores (_) to separate the words. This is called snake_case naming convention.\n",
    "4. Avoid using reserved keywords, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `else`, etc., as variable names.\n",
    "5. Use uppercase letters only for constants, which are values that never change during the program's execution. By convention, constants are named using all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of good variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "hourly_rate = 15.50\n",
    "MAX_RETRIES = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.4. Mutable/Immutable:**\n",
    "In Python, mutable types are the types of objects whose values can be changed after they are created, while immutable types are the types of objects whose values cannot be changed after they are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable types:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable types:\n",
    "- Numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers)\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Frozen sets (immutable sets)\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an immutable object is created, its value cannot be changed. If you try to change the value of an immutable object, Python will create a new object with the new value instead. On the other hand, for mutable objects, you can change their values directly without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Numbers and arithmetic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative. In Python, integers have unlimited precision, meaning that they can be arbitrarily large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum and maximum representable integers in Python are available through the `sys` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.maxsize)      # 9223372036854775807 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "print(-sys.maxsize - 1) # -9223372036854775808 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common operations with integers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.1. Arithmetic Operators:**\n",
    "- Addition: `3 + 2`\n",
    "- Subtraction: `3 - 2`\n",
    "- Multiplication: `3 * 2`\n",
    "- Division: `3 / 2`\n",
    "- Floor Division: `3 // 2`  *divides 3 by 2 and returns the floor of the result (1).*\n",
    "- Exponent: `3 ** 2`  *raises 3 to the power of 2 (9).*\n",
    "- Modulus: `3 % 2` *divides 3 by 2 and returns the remainder (1).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.2. Comparisons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equal: `3 == 2`\n",
    "- Not Equal: `3 != 2`\n",
    "- Greater Than: `3 > 2`\n",
    "- Less Than: `3 < 2`\n",
    "- Greater or Equal: `3 >= 2`\n",
    "- Less or Equal: `3 <= 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(3 + 2)    # 5\n",
    "print(3 - 2)    # 1\n",
    "print(3 * 2)    # 6\n",
    "print(3 / 2)    # 1.5\n",
    "print(3 // 2)   # 1\n",
    "print(3 ** 2)   # 9\n",
    "print(3 % 2)    # 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(3 == 2)   # False\n",
    "print(3 != 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 > 2)    # True\n",
    "print(3 < 2)    # False\n",
    "print(3 >= 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 <= 2)   # False\n",
    "```\n",

    "### SubChapter 3. Strings and string manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.1. What is a string:** A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They can be manipulated in various ways to extract or change parts of the string.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single quote string: `'Hello, world!'`\n",
    "- Double quote string: `\"Hello, world!\"`\n",

    "It can contain multiple lines of text.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.2. String methods:** Python provides several built-in methods for working with strings. Some of the most common ones include `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `find()`, `startswith()`, and `endswith()`. Knowing how to use these methods can help with common string manipulations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lower()`: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"HELLO\".lower()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `upper()`: Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello\".upper()` returns `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
    "- `strip()`: Removes whitespace from both ends of the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"   hello   \".strip()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `replace()`: Replaces a specified substring with another substring in the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".replace(\"world\", \"Python\")` returns `\"hello Python\"`.\n",
    "- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello,world\".split(\",\")` returns `[\"hello\", \"world\"]`.\n",
    "- `join()`: Joins a sequence of strings into a single string using the string as a delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\", \".join([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])` returns `\"apple, banana, cherry\"`.\n",
    "- `find()`: Searches the string for a specified substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".find(\"world\")` returns `6`.\n",
    "- `startswith()`: Returns `True` if the string starts with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".startswith(\"hello\")` returns `True`.\n",
    "- `endswith()`: Returns `True` if the string ends with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",

    "\n",
    "*`f-strings`*, also known as formatted string literals or f-string literals for short, provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax. To create an f-string, you start a string with the letter \"f\" or \"F\" before the opening quotation mark of a string. You can then embed Python expressions(or more typically variables) inside the string by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`. <br>\n",
    "Inside the curly braces we can put any python object that has a string representation (more on this later).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### My name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",

    "```\n",
    "* **5.2 Tuple methods:**\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning that their contents cannot be changed once created. Therefore, they have fewer methods than lists. Here are some of the most common tuple methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count()`: Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.count(5)` returns the number of times `5` appears in `my_tuple`.\n",
    "2. `index()`: Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the index of its first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.index(3)` returns the index of the first occurrence of `3` in `my_tuple`.\n",

    "1. Indexing operator `[]`: Used to access individual elements of a tuple by their index.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(my_tuple[0])` will output `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concatenation operator `+`: Used to concatenate two or more tuples into a single tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)` ; `print(my_tuple)` will output `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`.\n",

    "3. Repetition operator `*`: Used to repeat a tuple a certain number of times.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2) * 3` ; `print(my_tuple)` will output `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)`.\n",

    "5. Membership operator `not in`: Used to check if an element is not present in a tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(4 not in my_tuple)` will output `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tuples are immutable, so the use of operators that modify them, such as the assignment operator `=`, will result in a new tuple being created instead of modifying the original one.\n",

    "* **6.1. What are dictionaries:**\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are also known as associative arrays, maps, or hash maps in other programming languages. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `new_dict = my_dict.copy()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `get(key[, default])`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it returns the default value. If the default value is not provided, it returns `None`.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.get('key', 'default_value')`\n",

    "6. `values()`: Returns a view object that contains all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_values = my_dict.values()`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `pop(key[, default])`: Removes the key-value pair for the given key and returns the value. If the key is not present in the dictionary and no default value is provided, it raises a `KeyError`.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.pop('key', 'default_value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `popitem()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary as a tuple. If the dictionary is empty, it raises a `KeyError`.\n",
    "   - Example: `key_value_pair = my_dict.popitem()`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `setdefault(key[, default])`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it sets the key with the default value and returns it. If the default value is not provided, it sets the key with `None` and returns it.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.setdefault('key', 'default_value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `update(other_dict)`: Updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from the other dictionary. If a key already exists in the dictionary, the corresponding value gets updated.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_dict.update(other_dict)`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **6.3. Dictionary \"operators\":**\n",
    "There are no specific \"operators\" for dictionaries in Python. However, you can use the `in` operator to check if a key exists in a dictionary. Here's an example:\n",

    "Overall, loops are essential for efficient and effective programming, especially when working with large datasets or when automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `while` loop:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. Here is the basic syntax for a `while` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code block to execute while the condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is `True`, the code block is executed. This process continues until the condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to exit a `while` loop prematurely. The `continue` statement can be used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `while` loop that prints out the numbers 0 to 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use an `else` clause with a `while` loop. The code in the `else` block is executed after the loop has finished executing, as long as the loop didn't end prematurely with a `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `while` loop with an `else` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "Loop finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the code block for the current iteration of the loop. Here is an example of a `while` loop that uses `continue` to skip printing the number 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to exit the loop prematurely. Here is an example of a `while` loop that exits when the number 3 is printed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `for` loop:** \n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or dictionary) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The syntax for a for loop is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable` is a variable that takes on the value of each item in the `sequence` for each iteration of the loop. The code block to be executed is indented under the `for` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement can be used inside a for loop to skip over certain iterations and move on to the next one. The `break` statement can be used to exit the loop completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a for loop that iterates over a list and uses the `continue` statement to skip over even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop does have an `else` statement that can be used to execute a block of code after the loop has finished iterating over the sequence. This block of code is executed only if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a `break` statement. The syntax for a `for` loop with an `else` statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a break statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a `for` loop with an `else` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == 0:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop completed all iterations without encountering a break statement.\")\n",

    "The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 (by default) and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three examples of how to use the `range()` function in a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple example with one parameter:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (not including 5), which is then iterated over in the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example with start and stop parameters:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(2, 8):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 2 to 7 (not including 8), which is then iterated over in the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example with start, stop, and step parameters:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0, 10, 2):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "8\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 8 (not including 10) with a step size of 2, which is then iterated over in the `for` loop.\n",

    "## Chapter 5: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow us to reuse code and make it more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Defining functions\n",
    " In Python, we can define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, and a set of parentheses that can contain zero or more parameters. The function body is indented and contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple function that takes no arguments and returns a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    return \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `say_hello`. Since this function does not take any arguments, the parentheses are empty. The function body is indented and contains a single statement that returns the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To call this function, we simply write its name followed by a set of parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(say_hello())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the string \"Hello, world!\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Parameters and arguments\n",
    "* **Parameters and arguments:**\n",
    "In Python, a function parameter is a variable used in the function definition to represent a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. An argument, on the other hand, is a value passed to a function when it is called, and corresponds to a parameter of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a parameter is a variable name defined in the function, while an argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a function definition that takes a parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `name` is the parameter of the function `greet`. When the function is called, an argument can be passed to the `name` parameter, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the string `\"Alice\"` is the argument that is passed to the `name` parameter of the `greet` function. The output of this function call would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **`*args` and `**kwargs`:**\n",
    "In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` are special syntax used in function definitions to allow the passing of a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`*args` is used to pass a variable-length list of non-keyworded arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of arguments to a function. The `*` before the parameter name tells Python that there may be any number of arguments passed to the function, and these arguments will be collected into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `*args`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_numbers(*args):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for num in args:\n",
    "        total += num\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3)) # Output: 6\n",
    "print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`**kwargs` is used to pass a variable-length dictionary of keyword arguments to a function. The `**` before the parameter name tells Python that there may be any number of keyword arguments passed to the function, and these arguments will be collected into a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `**kwargs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_values(**kwargs):\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print_values(name=\"John\", age=30, city=\"New York\") # Output: name: John, age: 30, city: New York\n",
    "print_values(country=\"France\", language=\"French\") # Output: country: France, language: French\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 3. Return statements\n",
    "A return statement in a function is used to return a value or a set of values to the caller of the function. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning a single value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = square(5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning multiple values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def powers(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2, x ** 3, x ** 4\n",
    "\n",
    "square, cube, fourth_power = powers(2)\n",
    "print(square, cube, fourth_power)  # Output: 4 8 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking the returned values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_name():\n",
    "    return \"John\", \"Doe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "first_name, last_name = get_name()\n",
    "print(first_name, last_name)  # Output: John Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the function `get_name()` returns two values which are assigned to the variables `first_name` and `last_name` using tuple unpacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking is the process of extracting values from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and assigning them to separate variables. It allows you to conveniently access the individual elements of a collection without having to access them one at a time using indexing or slicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can unpack an iterable by assigning its values to a comma-separated list of variables. The number of variables on the left side of the assignment must match the number of elements in the iterable, otherwise you will get a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of unpacking a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    ">>> a, b, c = tuple\n",
    ">>> print(a, b, c)\n",
    "1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `*` operator to capture the remaining values of an iterable that you don't want to unpack into individual variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    ">>> a, b, *rest = tuple\n",
    ">>> print(a, b, rest)\n",
    "1 2 [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `*rest` variable captures the remaining elements of the tuple after the first two have been unpacked into `a` and `b`.\n"
