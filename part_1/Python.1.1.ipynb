    "## Overview of Python and its uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python's popularity is due to its versatility and wide range of applications, which include web development, scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, network automation, and artificial intelligence. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use for both beginners and experienced programmers. Python also has a large and active community that contributes to its development and supports users through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn:** Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Python has a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning, making it a versatile language to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large and Active Community:** Python has a large and active community of users who contribute to its development and provide support through online resources and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excellent Libraries and Frameworks:** Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop complex applications quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python code can be run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a flexible choice for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slower Execution Speeds:** Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. This can be a disadvantage in performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the performance of multithreaded applications, which can be a concern for applications that require high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, which means that type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time. This can lead to more errors in code that are not caught until runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Less Suitable for Mobile App Development:** Python is not well-suited for mobile app development due to its slower performance and limitations on mobile platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Compatibility:** Python has multiple versions, and code written in one version may not be compatible with other versions, which can be a concern for developers. (less relevant since Python2 is no longer in scope. Most libraries and packages work well with all Python3 distributions)\n",

    "## Running Python code in the interpreter and in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in the interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is a command-line interface that allows you to execute Python code directly in the terminal. This is useful for quick testing and debugging of code snippets. Here is an example of running Python code in the interpreter:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf> python\n",
    "Python 3.11.3 (tags/v3.11.3:f3909b8, Apr  4 2023, 23:49:59) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "Hello world!\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we start the Python interpreter by running the `python` command in the terminal. Once inside the interpreter, we can execute Python code by typing it directly into the terminal. In this case, we print the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python code in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code can also be saved in a file with a `.py` extension and executed using the Python interpreter. This is useful for more complex programs and allows you to save and share your code. Here is an example of running Python code in a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`hello.py`\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a file called `hello.py` and save it in our current working directory. The file contains a single line of Python code that prints the string \"Hello, world!\" using the `print()` function. To execute the code in the file, we run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\github\\python_course_vf\\part_1> python .\\hello.py\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will execute the code in the `hello.py` file using the Python interpreter and print the output to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between running Python code in the interpreter and in a file is that the interpreter allows you to execute code line-by-line and experiment with Python features interactively, while running code in a file allows you to create more complex programs and execute them as a whole.\n",

    "## Chapter 2: Basic Python Syntax and Data Types  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Variables and variable types\n",
    "* **1.1. What are variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named reference to a value that can be manipulated by your program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and collections like lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables don't have a type specified at the time they are created. Instead, their type is determined dynamically based on the value that is assigned to them. This allows for more flexibility in programming, but can also lead to potential errors if variables are not used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common variable types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers**: Variables that hold whole numbers, such as `42` or `-3`.\n",
    "- **Floating point numbers**: Variables that hold decimal numbers, such as `3.14` or `-0.5`.\n",
    "- **Strings**: Variables that hold text, such as `\"Hello, world!\"` or `'Python is awesome!'`.\n",
    "- **Booleans**: Variables that hold either `True` or `False` values, which are used for logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has some collection variable types, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Lists are defined using square brackets, such as `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Tuples are defined using parentheses, such as `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, which can be of different types. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces, such as `{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable types and how to use them correctly is fundamental to programming in Python. It allows you to store and manipulate different types of data, and perform various operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.2. Creating variables**: \n",
    "To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the equal sign `=`. The basic syntax for creating a variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable_name` is the name of the variable, and `value` is the value that you want to assign to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create an integer variable `x` with the value of `5`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to create a string variable `name` with the value of `\"Alice\"`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list variable `my_list` with a list of numbers, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple variable `my_tuple` with a tuple of strings, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dictionary variable `my_dict` with a dictionary of key-value pairs, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"gender\": \"female\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.3. Naming conventions for variables:**\n",
    "In Python, there are some general naming conventions for variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "2. Variables should start with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "3. If a variable name contains more than one word, use underscores (_) to separate the words. This is called snake_case naming convention.\n",
    "4. Avoid using reserved keywords, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `else`, etc., as variable names.\n",
    "5. Use uppercase letters only for constants, which are values that never change during the program's execution. By convention, constants are named using all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of good variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "hourly_rate = 15.50\n",
    "MAX_RETRIES = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.4. Mutable/Immutable:**\n",
    "In Python, mutable types are the types of objects whose values can be changed after they are created, while immutable types are the types of objects whose values cannot be changed after they are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable types:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable types:\n",
    "- Numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers)\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Frozen sets (immutable sets)\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an immutable object is created, its value cannot be changed. If you try to change the value of an immutable object, Python will create a new object with the new value instead. On the other hand, for mutable objects, you can change their values directly without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Numbers and arithmetic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative. In Python, integers have unlimited precision, meaning that they can be arbitrarily large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum and maximum representable integers in Python are available through the `sys` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.maxsize)      # 9223372036854775807 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "print(-sys.maxsize - 1) # -9223372036854775808 on a 64-bit system\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common operations with integers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.1. Arithmetic Operators:**\n",
    "- Addition: `3 + 2`\n",
    "- Subtraction: `3 - 2`\n",
    "- Multiplication: `3 * 2`\n",
    "- Division: `3 / 2`\n",
    "- Floor Division: `3 // 2`  *divides 3 by 2 and returns the floor of the result (1).*\n",
    "- Exponent: `3 ** 2`  *raises 3 to the power of 2 (9).*\n",
    "- Modulus: `3 % 2` *divides 3 by 2 and returns the remainder (1).*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.2. Comparisons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equal: `3 == 2`\n",
    "- Not Equal: `3 != 2`\n",
    "- Greater Than: `3 > 2`\n",
    "- Less Than: `3 < 2`\n",
    "- Greater or Equal: `3 >= 2`\n",
    "- Less or Equal: `3 <= 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(3 + 2)    # 5\n",
    "print(3 - 2)    # 1\n",
    "print(3 * 2)    # 6\n",
    "print(3 / 2)    # 1.5\n",
    "print(3 // 2)   # 1\n",
    "print(3 ** 2)   # 9\n",
    "print(3 % 2)    # 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(3 == 2)   # False\n",
    "print(3 != 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 > 2)    # True\n",
    "print(3 < 2)    # False\n",
    "print(3 >= 2)   # True\n",
    "print(3 <= 2)   # False\n",

    "### SubChapter 3. Strings and string manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.1. What is a string:** A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They can be manipulated in various ways to extract or change parts of the string.<br>\n",

    "It can contain multiple lines of text.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.2. String methods:** Python provides several built-in methods for working with strings. Some of the most common ones include `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `find()`, `startswith()`, and `endswith()`. Knowing how to use these methods can help with common string manipulations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lower()`: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"HELLO\".lower()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `upper()`: Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello\".upper()` returns `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
    "- `strip()`: Removes whitespace from both ends of the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"   hello   \".strip()` returns `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "- `replace()`: Replaces a specified substring with another substring in the string.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".replace(\"world\", \"Python\")` returns `\"hello Python\"`.\n",
    "- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello,world\".split(\",\")` returns `[\"hello\", \"world\"]`.\n",
    "- `join()`: Joins a sequence of strings into a single string using the string as a delimiter.\n",
    "    - Example: `\", \".join([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])` returns `\"apple, banana, cherry\"`.\n",
    "- `find()`: Searches the string for a specified substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".find(\"world\")` returns `6`.\n",
    "- `startswith()`: Returns `True` if the string starts with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",
    "    - Example: `\"hello world\".startswith(\"hello\")` returns `True`.\n",
    "- `endswith()`: Returns `True` if the string ends with a specified substring, otherwise returns `False`.\n",

    "* **3.4. String formatting:** Python provides several ways to format strings, including using the `%` operator, the `format()` method, and `f-strings` (we will be focusing on these). Understanding how to use string formatting can make code more readable and maintainable.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*`f-strings`*, also known as formatted string literals or f-string literals for short, provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax. To create an f-string, you start a string with the letter \"f\" or \"F\" before the opening quotation mark of a string. You can then embed Python expressions(or more typically variables) inside the string by wrapping them in curly braces `{}`. <br>\n",
    "Inside the curly braces we can put any python object that has a string representation (more on this later).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### My name is John and I am 30 years old.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `count()`: Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.count(5)` returns the number of times `5` appears in `my_tuple`.\n",
    "2. `index()`: Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the index of its first occurrence.\n",
    "    - Example: `my_tuple.index(3)` returns the index of the first occurrence of `3` in `my_tuple`.\n",

    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(my_tuple[0])` will output `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concatenation operator `+`: Used to concatenate two or more tuples into a single tuple.\n",
    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)` ; `print(my_tuple)` will output `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`.\n",

    "   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` ; `print(4 not in my_tuple)` will output `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tuples are immutable, so the use of operators that modify them, such as the assignment operator `=`, will result in a new tuple being created instead of modifying the original one.\n",

    "* **6.1. What are dictionaries:**\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are also known as associative arrays, maps, or hash maps in other programming languages. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "9. `setdefault(key[, default])`: Returns the value for a given key. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it sets the key with the default value and returns it. If the default value is not provided, it sets the key with `None` and returns it.\n",
    "   - Example: `value = my_dict.setdefault('key', 'default_value')`\n",

    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. What are regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters used to define a search pattern. They provide a powerful and flexible way to match, search, and manipulate text data. Regular expressions are widely used in various programming languages and text processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular expression, characters can represent either themselves or special metacharacters that have special meanings. These metacharacters allow you to define patterns and rules for matching strings. Here are some commonly used metacharacters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.` (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.\n",
    "- `^` (caret): Matches the beginning of a string or line.\n",
    "- `$` (dollar): Matches the end of a string or line.\n",
    "- `*` (asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "- `+` (plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "- `?` (question mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "- `[]` (square brackets): Matches any character within the brackets.\n",
    "- `()` (parentheses): Creates a capturing group or specifies the order of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions allow you to perform various operations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matching**: Determine whether a pattern matches a given string.\n",
    "- **Searching**: Find the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger string.\n",
    "- **Replacing**: Replace a pattern with a different string.\n",
    "- **Splitting**: Split a string into multiple parts based on a pattern.\n",
    "- **Validating**: Check if a string meets certain criteria based on a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a regular expression pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern represents a phone number in the format `###-###-####`, where each `#` represents a digit from 0 to 9. The `\\d` metacharacter matches any digit, and the `{3}` specifies that it should occur exactly three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be more complex and can involve a combination of metacharacters, character classes, quantifiers, anchors, and more. They provide a concise and powerful way to work with textual data and perform pattern matching operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that regular expressions can have differences in syntax and behavior across different programming languages and tools. The specific implementation of regular expressions may vary, so it's recommended to consult the documentation or resources specific to the programming language or tool you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Writing regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing regular expressions, there are a few key components to consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Literal Characters**: Literal characters in a regular expression match themselves. For example, the regular expression `cat` matches the sequence of characters 'cat' in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metacharacters**: Metacharacters have special meanings in regular expressions. Some commonly used metacharacters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `.`, `^`, `$`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `[]`, `()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Character Classes**: Character classes allow you to match specific sets or ranges of characters. Some common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `[0-9]`: Matches any digit.\n",
    "   - `[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter.\n",
    "   - `[A-Z]`: Matches any uppercase letter.\n",
    "   - `[A-Za-z]`: Matches any letter (both lowercase and uppercase).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quantifiers**: Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. Some common quantifiers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.\n",
    "   - `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.\n",
    "   - `{n,m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anchors**: Anchors are used to match positions within a string. Some commonly used anchors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `^` (caret): Matches the beginning of a string or line.\n",
    "   - `$` (dollar): Matches the end of a string or line.\n",
    "   - `\\b` (word boundary): Matches a word boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Escaping**: To match a metacharacter as a literal character, you need to escape it using a backslash `\\`. For example, to match a literal dot character, you would use `\\.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to test and validate your regular expressions against different inputs to ensure they behave as expected. Various online tools and regex testing websites can be helpful in experimenting with and debugging regular expressions.\n",

    "### SubChapter 3. Practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a hypothetical text input for our examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n",
    "Email: john.doe@example.com\n",
    "Phone: (555) 123-4567\n",
    "Date: 2023-05-26\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore some practical examples using regex to extract information from this text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matching an Email Address**:\n",
    "   Regex Pattern: `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\\b`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This pattern can be used to find and extract email addresses from the text. It matches common email address formats, ensuring the presence of the `@` symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain (TLD). In our example, it would match `john.doe@example.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matching a Phone Number**:\n",
    "   Regex Pattern: `\\(\\d{3}\\) \\d{3}-\\d{4}`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This pattern can be used to find and extract phone numbers in the format `(555) 123-4567`. It matches the specific pattern of three digits enclosed in parentheses, followed by a space, three digits, a hyphen, and finally, four digits. In our example, it would match `(555) 123-4567`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching a Date**:\n",
    "   Regex Pattern: `\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This pattern can be used to find and extract dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. It matches four digits, followed by a hyphen, two digits, another hyphen, and finally, two more digits. In our example, it would match `2023-05-26`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples to demonstrate how regular expressions can be used to extract specific information from a text. Keep in mind that the actual implementation may vary depending on the programming language you're using, as different languages may have slightly different syntax or APIs for working with regular expressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Character sets, also known as character classes, allow you to define a set of characters that you want to match within a regular expression. They provide a concise way to specify multiple alternatives for a single position in the pattern. Here are some examples of character sets and their brief definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\\w**: Matches any word character, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\\d**: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[.,!?]**: Matches any punctuation mark, such as a period, comma, exclamation mark, or question mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **[a-zA-Z]**: Matches any alphabetic character, both uppercase and lowercase.\n",
    "\n",

    "### SubChapter 5. Quantifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifiers in regular expressions allow you to specify how many times a pattern should occur. They control the repetition of the preceding element in the pattern. Here are some examples of quantifiers and their brief explanations:\n",

    "### SubChapter 7. Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "#### 7.1 The `re` module\n",
    "The `re` module in Python provides a powerful toolset for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, allowing you to match, search, and manipulate text data effectively. The `re` module allows you to perform various operations such as pattern matching, searching, splitting, and substitution within strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `re` module, you need to import it at the beginning of your Python script or interactive session using the following import statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once imported, you can access the functions and methods provided by the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the commonly used functions and methods in the `re` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   Searches for a pattern match anywhere in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   Attempts to match the pattern only at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern and returns a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   Finds all occurrences of the pattern and replaces them with the specified replacement string.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions and methods accept a regular expression pattern as the first argument, which defines the search pattern or the desired pattern for manipulation. The `string` argument represents the input text on which the pattern matching or manipulation is performed. Additional arguments such as `flags`, `maxsplit`, and `count` can be used to modify the behavior of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions in Python are defined using special syntax and metacharacters that allow you to express complex patterns. The `re` module supports a wide range of metacharacters, quantifiers, character classes, anchors, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing the `re` module in Python, you can efficiently work with text data by searching for patterns, extracting specific information, validating input, or transforming text based on specific rules defined by regular expressions.\n",
    "#### 7.2 Examples for the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Searches for a pattern match anywhere in the string.\n",
    "   - Example: `re.search(r'world', 'Hello, world!')` would find a match for \"world\" in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Attempts to match the pattern only at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - Example: `re.match(r'Hello', 'Hello, world!')` would find a match for \"Hello\" in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern as a list.\n",
    "   - Example: `re.findall(r'\\d+', 'I have 3 apples and 5 oranges')` would return `['3', '5']` as matches for digits in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern and returns a list.\n",
    "   - Example: `re.split(r'\\s', 'Hello world!')` would split the string at every whitespace character and return `['Hello', 'world!']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Finds all occurrences of the pattern and replaces them with the specified replacement string.\n",
    "   - Example: `re.sub(r'\\d+', 'X', 'I have 3 apples and 5 oranges')` would replace all digits with 'X', resulting in the string `'I have X apples and X oranges'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are part of the `re` module in Python's standard library, which provides functionalities for working with regular expressions. By using these methods and applying appropriate patterns, you can search, match, split, and substitute text in Python based on regular expression patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 4: Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures are programming constructs that allow the flow of control to be altered based on certain conditions or events. They allow the programmer to determine the order in which instructions are executed and to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Common control structures include if-else statements, loops (for and while), and break and continue statements. These structures are used extensively in programming to create complex logic and decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. If-else statements\n",
    "\n",
    "If-else statements are conditional statements used in programming to execute different blocks of code based on a specified condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for an If-else statement in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # execute code block1 if condition1 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # execute code block2 if condition1 is False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `condition1` is the condition to be checked, `code block1` is the block of code to be executed if `condition1` is `True`, and `code block2` is the block of code to be executed if `condition1` is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some examples of If-else statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Checking if a number is even or odd\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is even.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is odd.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The number is odd.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Checking if a person is eligible to vote\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 17\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are not eligible to vote.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that uses `elif` in addition to `if` and `else`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"B\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"C\")\n",
    "elif score >= 60:\n",
    "    print(\"D\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"F\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the program evaluates the `score` variable and prints out the corresponding grade using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. If the `score` is greater than or equal to 90, it prints \"A\". If the `score` is between 80 and 90 (inclusive), it prints \"B\". If the `score` is between 70 and 80 (inclusive), it prints \"C\". If the `score` is between 60 and 70 (inclusive), it prints \"D\". Otherwise, if the `score` is less than 60, it prints \"F\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Loops (for and while)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use loops in programming to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Loops allow us to automate repetitive tasks and process large amounts of data efficiently. There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` and `while`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, loops are essential for efficient and effective programming, especially when working with large datasets or when automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `while` loop:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. Here is the basic syntax for a `while` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code block to execute while the condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is `True`, the code block is executed. This process continues until the condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to exit a `while` loop prematurely. The `continue` statement can be used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `while` loop that prints out the numbers 0 to 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use an `else` clause with a `while` loop. The code in the `else` block is executed after the loop has finished executing, as long as the loop didn't end prematurely with a `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `while` loop with an `else` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "Loop finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the code block for the current iteration of the loop. Here is an example of a `while` loop that uses `continue` to skip printing the number 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to exit the loop prematurely. Here is an example of a `while` loop that exits when the number 3 is printed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",

    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or dictionary) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The syntax for a for loop is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable` is a variable that takes on the value of each item in the `sequence` for each iteration of the loop. The code block to be executed is indented under the `for` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement can be used inside a for loop to skip over certain iterations and move on to the next one. The `break` statement can be used to exit the loop completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a for loop that iterates over a list and uses the `continue` statement to skip over even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",

    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop does have an `else` statement that can be used to execute a block of code after the loop has finished iterating over the sequence. This block of code is executed only if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a `break` statement. The syntax for a `for` loop with an `else` statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a break statement\n",

    "The `range()` function in Python returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 (by default) and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three examples of how to use the `range()` function in a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple example with one parameter:\n",

    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (not including 5), which is then iterated over in the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example with start and stop parameters:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 2 to 7 (not including 8), which is then iterated over in the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Chapter 5: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow us to reuse code and make it more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Defining functions\n",
    " In Python, we can define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, and a set of parentheses that can contain zero or more parameters. The function body is indented and contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple function that takes no arguments and returns a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    return \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `say_hello`. Since this function does not take any arguments, the parentheses are empty. The function body is indented and contains a single statement that returns the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To call this function, we simply write its name followed by a set of parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(say_hello())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the string \"Hello, world!\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 2. Parameters and arguments\n",
    "* **Parameters and arguments:**\n",
    "In Python, a function parameter is a variable used in the function definition to represent a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. An argument, on the other hand, is a value passed to a function when it is called, and corresponds to a parameter of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a parameter is a variable name defined in the function, while an argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a function definition that takes a parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `name` is the parameter of the function `greet`. When the function is called, an argument can be passed to the `name` parameter, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the string `\"Alice\"` is the argument that is passed to the `name` parameter of the `greet` function. The output of this function call would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **`*args` and `**kwargs`:**\n",
    "In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` are special syntax used in function definitions to allow the passing of a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`*args` is used to pass a variable-length list of non-keyworded arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of arguments to a function. The `*` before the parameter name tells Python that there may be any number of arguments passed to the function, and these arguments will be collected into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `*args`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_numbers(*args):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for num in args:\n",
    "        total += num\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3)) # Output: 6\n",
    "print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`**kwargs` is used to pass a variable-length dictionary of keyword arguments to a function. The `**` before the parameter name tells Python that there may be any number of keyword arguments passed to the function, and these arguments will be collected into a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `**kwargs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_values(**kwargs):\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print_values(name=\"John\", age=30, city=\"New York\") # Output: name: John, age: 30, city: New York\n",
    "print_values(country=\"France\", language=\"French\") # Output: country: France, language: French\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 3. Return statements\n",
    "A return statement in a function is used to return a value or a set of values to the caller of the function. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning a single value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = square(5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning multiple values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def powers(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2, x ** 3, x ** 4\n",
    "\n",
    "square, cube, fourth_power = powers(2)\n",
    "print(square, cube, fourth_power)  # Output: 4 8 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking the returned values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_name():\n",
    "    return \"John\", \"Doe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "first_name, last_name = get_name()\n",
    "print(first_name, last_name)  # Output: John Doe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the function `get_name()` returns two values which are assigned to the variables `first_name` and `last_name` using tuple unpacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking is the process of extracting values from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and assigning them to separate variables. It allows you to conveniently access the individual elements of a collection without having to access them one at a time using indexing or slicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can unpack an iterable by assigning its values to a comma-separated list of variables. The number of variables on the left side of the assignment must match the number of elements in the iterable, otherwise you will get a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of unpacking a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    ">>> a, b, c = tuple\n",
    ">>> print(a, b, c)\n",
    "1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `*` operator to capture the remaining values of an iterable that you don't want to unpack into individual variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    ">>> a, b, *rest = tuple\n",
    ">>> print(a, b, rest)\n",
    "1 2 [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `*rest` variable captures the remaining elements of the tuple after the first two have been unpacked into `a` and `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 6. Working with files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SubChapter 1. Reading and writing text files\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure! Working with files is an essential part of programming, and Python provides several ways to work with files. In Python, you can open a file, read or write data to the file, and then close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file, you can use the built-in `open()` function. The syntax of the `open()` function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `filename` is the name of the file that you want to open and `mode` is the access mode in which you want to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different modes available for opening a file, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `r`: read mode (default)\n",
    "- `w`: write mode, truncate the file if it exists\n",
    "- `a`: write mode, append to the file if it exists\n",
    "- `x`: exclusive creation mode, fails if the file already exists\n",
    "- `b`: binary mode\n",
    "- `t`: text mode (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have opened the file, you can perform read or write operations on the file using various file methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context Managers:**\n",
    "A context manager is an object that is used to manage resources, such as file streams or database connections, in a Python program. It defines a way to acquire and release a resource automatically in a safe and predictable way. The primary purpose of a context manager is to make sure that the resource is properly cleaned up after it is no longer needed, even if an error occurs while using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `with` statement is used to define a context manager, which provides a convenient way to manage resources that need to be cleaned up or released after they are used. The `with` statement automatically acquires the resource at the beginning of the block, and releases it at the end of the block. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is preferred over using `file = open()` because it provides a more concise and readable way of working with resources, and it guarantees that the resource is properly closed, even if an error occurs while working with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between using `file = open()` and `with open() as f` is that the latter automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed, whereas the former requires manually closing the file using the `close()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `with open() as f` is known as the \"context manager\" approach and it is the preferred method for working with files in Python. It is not only more concise and easier to read, but it also ensures that the file is closed properly, even if an exception is raised within the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of opening a file using both methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Using file = open()\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using with open() as f\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we explicitly open the file using `open()`, read its contents, and then close it using the `close()` method. In the second example, we use `with open() as f` to automatically open the file, read its contents, and then close it when the block of code is finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples:**\n",
    "Sure, here are some examples of reading from and writing to a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading from a file:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading the entire file as a string:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    contents = f.read()\n",
    "print(contents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reading the file line by line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        print(line.strip())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reading the file into a list of lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    lines = f.readlines()\n",
    "print(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing to a file:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing a string to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Writing a list of strings to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = ['line 1', 'line 2', 'line 3']\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    for line in lines:\n",
    "        f.write(line + '\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Appending a string to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'a') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In these examples, the `with` statement is used to automatically close the file when the block is exited.\n",

    "### SubChapter 2. Working with CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a common way to store and exchange data between different programs. Here are some things you should know about working with CSV files in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python has a built-in `csv` module that makes it easy to read and write CSV files.\n",
    "2. To read a CSV file, you can open it using `csv.reader()`. This returns an object that you can iterate over to read the rows of the file.\n",
    "3. Each row in a CSV file is represented as a list of values.\n",
    "4. By default, the `csv.reader()` function assumes that the values in the file are separated by commas. However, you can specify a different delimiter if necessary.\n",
    "5. To write to a CSV file, you can open it using `csv.writer()`. This returns an object that you can use to write rows to the file.\n",
    "6. You can also use the `csv.DictReader()` and `csv.DictWriter()` classes to read and write CSV files as dictionaries, where each row is represented as a dictionary with keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to read a CSV file using `csv.reader()`:\n",
    "\n",

    "    writer.writerow(['Bob', 30, 'Canada'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code writes the following data to a file named 'data.csv':\n",

    "Name,Age,Country\n",
    "Alice,25,USA\n",
    "Bob,30,Canada\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of reading a CSV file without using a specialized module in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a CSV file named `data.csv` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "Name, Age, Gender\n",
    "John, 25, Male\n",
    "Sarah, 30, Female\n",
    "Tom, 20, Male\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To read this file, we can use Python's built-in `open()` function to open the file and then read its content line by line. We can then split each line by the comma delimiter and store the values in a list. Here's the code:\n",

    "```\n",
    "with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed properly after it has been read. The `readlines()` method reads all the lines of the file and returns them as a list of strings. We then loop through each line and split it by the comma delimiter using the `split()` method. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line. Finally, we store the values in variables and print them to the console.\n",

    "Here are a few things to know about working with JSON files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON files contain data in key-value pairs, just like dictionaries in Python.\n",

    "- When writing data to a JSON file, we can use the `indent` parameter to specify the number of spaces to use for indentation. This can make the JSON file easier to read.\n",
    "- When reading data from a JSON file, the resulting data will be a Python object, such as a dictionary or list, that corresponds to the JSON data.\n",

    "### SubChapter 4. Working with XML Files:\n",
    "XML stands for \"Extensible Markup Language\". It is a markup language like HTML, but its tags are not predefined. Instead, users can define their own tags and use them to structure data. XML files are commonly used for data exchange between applications and for storing configuration data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with XML files in Python, you can use the built-in `xml` module. Here are some key things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ElementTree` class is the main class for working with XML in Python.\n",
    "- You can parse an XML file using the `ElementTree.parse()` method, which returns an `ElementTree` object.\n",
    "- Once you have an `ElementTree` object, you can navigate the XML structure using the `Element` and `ElementTree` methods.\n",
    "- You can create a new XML tree from scratch using the `ElementTree.Element()` method to create a new element, and the `ElementTree.SubElement()` method to create child elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of parsing an XML file and accessing its elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n",
    "\n",
    "# parse the XML file\n",
    "tree = ET.parse('example.xml')\n",
    "\n",
    "# get the root element\n",
    "root = tree.getroot()\n",
    "\n",
    "# access an element's tag and text\n",
    "print(root[0].tag)\n",
    "print(root[0].text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# access an element's attributes\n",
    "print(root[0].attrib['id'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterate over child elements and access their tags and text\n",
    "for child in root:\n",
    "    print(child.tag, child.text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's an example of creating a new XML tree from scratch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n",
    "\n",
    "# create the root element\n",
    "root = ET.Element('catalog')\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a new element and add it to the root\n",
    "book = ET.SubElement(root, 'book')\n",
    "book.set('id', 'bk001')\n",
    "title = ET.SubElement(book, 'title')\n",
    "title.text = 'The Cat in the Hat'\n",
    "author = ET.SubElement(book, 'author')\n",
    "author.text = 'Dr. Seuss'\n",
    "price = ET.SubElement(book, 'price')\n",
    "price.text = '19.99'\n",
    "\n",
    "# write the XML tree to a file\n",
    "tree = ET.ElementTree(root)\n",
    "tree.write('catalog.xml')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is often easier to work with XML files using a specialized library such as `lxml` or `xmltodict`. These libraries provide more convenient APIs for working with XML data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`lxml`** is a Python library that provides a powerful toolkit for processing XML and HTML documents. It is a third-party library that is not included in the standard Python library, but can be easily installed using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you should know about working with lxml:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parsing XML documents: lxml provides a set of parsers that can be used to parse XML documents. The most commonly used parser is the lxml.etree.XMLParser, which provides a fast and memory-efficient way to parse XML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ElementTree API: lxml implements the ElementTree API, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with XML documents. You can use this API to access and modify the elements and attributes of an XML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. XPath and XSLT: lxml provides support for XPath and XSLT, two powerful languages for querying and transforming XML documents. XPath allows you to select elements and attributes in an XML document based on their name, value, or position. XSLT allows you to transform an XML document into another format, such as HTML, using a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance: lxml is known for its speed and efficiency. It uses C libraries to provide fast parsing and processing of XML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Namespace support: lxml provides full support for XML namespaces, which allow you to create and use XML elements and attributes with the same name, but different meanings, in the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, lxml is a powerful and flexible library that makes it easy to work with XML and HTML documents in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "lxml is a Python library that provides a powerful and efficient way to work with XML and HTML documents. Here are some common use cases for lxml with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parsing an XML Document: You can use lxml to parse an XML document and extract the required information. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from lxml import etree\n",
    "\n",
    "xml_string = \"<root><item><name>Item 1</name><price>10.00</price></item><item><name>Item 2</name><price>20.00</price></item></root>\"\n",
    "root = etree.fromstring(xml_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in root.xpath('//item'):\n",
    "    name = item.xpath('name/text()')[0]\n",
    "    price = float(item.xpath('price/text()')[0])\n",
    "    print(f\"{name}: {price}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code parses an XML string and extracts the name and price of each item using XPath.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modifying an XML Document: You can also use lxml to modify an XML document. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from lxml import etree\n",
    "\n",
    "xml_string = \"<root><item><name>Item 1</name><price>10.00</price></item><item><name>Item 2</name><price>20.00</price></item></root>\"\n",
    "root = etree.fromstring(xml_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new item\n",
    "new_item = etree.Element(\"item\")\n",
    "new_name = etree.SubElement(new_item, \"name\")\n",
    "new_name.text = \"Item 3\"\n",
    "new_price = etree.SubElement(new_item, \"price\")\n",
    "new_price.text = \"30.00\"\n",
    "root.append(new_item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify an existing item\n",
    "item2 = root.xpath('//item[name=\"Item 2\"]')[0]\n",
    "item2_price = item2.xpath('price/text()')[0]\n",
    "item2_price = str(float(item2_price) * 1.1)\n",
    "item2.xpath('price')[0].text = item2_price\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove an item\n",
    "item1 = root.xpath('//item[name=\"Item 1\"]')[0]\n",
    "root.remove(item1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(etree.tostring(root, pretty_print=True).decode())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code adds a new item, modifies the price of an existing item, and removes an item from the XML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scraping HTML: You can use lxml to scrape HTML pages and extract the required information. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "from lxml import html\n",
    "\n",
    "url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)'\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "tree = html.fromstring(response.content)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract the article title\n",
    "title = tree.xpath('//h1[@id=\"firstHeading\"]/text()')[0]\n",
    "print(title)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract the list of references\n",
    "references = tree.xpath('//ol[@class=\"references\"]/li')\n",
    "for reference in references:\n",
    "    text = reference.xpath('.//span[@class=\"reference-text\"]/text()')[0]\n",
    "    print(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code scrapes the Wikipedia page for Python and extracts the article title and the list of references.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`xmltodict` is a Python library that allows for the conversion of XML data to JSON format. Here's an example of how to use `xmltodict` to convert XML data to JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "# XML data as a string\n",
    "xml_string = '''\n",

    "    <color>red</color>\n",
    "    <price>1.00</price>\n",
    "</fruit>\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert XML string to OrderedDict\n",
    "xml_dict = xmltodict.parse(xml_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert OrderedDict to JSON\n",
    "json_data = json.dumps(xml_dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the resulting JSON\n",
    "print(json_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the following JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"fruit\": {\"name\": \"apple\", \"color\": \"red\", \"price\": \"1.00\"}}\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also use `xmltodict` to read and parse XML files, like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import xmltodict\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the XML file and read its contents\n",

    "\n",
    "### SubChapter xx. Converting JSON to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a JSON object to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, you can use the `json` and `csv` modules available in Python. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the JSON data**: Start by loading the JSON data into a Python object using the `json` module's `loads()` function if you have a JSON string, or the `load()` function if you have a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load JSON data from a file\n",
    "with open('data.json') as json_file:\n",
    "    data = json.load(json_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or, load JSON data from a string\n",
    "json_string = '{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}'\n",
    "data = json.loads(json_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare the CSV file**: Create a CSV file and open it in write mode using the `csv` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "csv_file = open('data.csv', 'w', newline='')\n",
    "csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Write the header**: If your JSON data has nested objects, you may want to extract the column headers. Assuming the JSON data is a list of dictionaries, you can extract the keys from the first dictionary and write them as the CSV header.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "header = data[0].keys()\n",
    "csv_writer.writerow(header)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Write the rows**: Iterate over the JSON data and write each dictionary's values as a row in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in data:\n",
    "    csv_writer.writerow(row.values())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Close the files**: Finally, don't forget to close both the JSON and CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "json_file.close()\n",
    "csv_file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, here's a complete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load JSON data from a file\n",
    "with open('data.json') as json_file:\n",
    "    data = json.load(json_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a CSV file\n",
    "csv_file = open('data.csv', 'w', newline='')\n",
    "csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the header\n",
    "header = data[0].keys()\n",
    "csv_writer.writerow(header)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the rows\n",
    "for row in data:\n",
    "    csv_writer.writerow(row.values())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the files\n",
    "json_file.close()\n",
    "csv_file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
